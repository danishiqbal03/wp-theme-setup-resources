To query meta: (example)

SELECT ud.ID, umt.meta_value AS first_name, umt2.meta_value AS last_name FROM wp_users AS ud 
LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS umt ON (ud.ID = umt.user_id AND umt.meta_key = 'first_name')  
LEFT JOIN wp_usermeta AS umt2 ON (ud.ID = umt2.user_id AND umt2.meta_key = 'last_name')

Pagination: (Example)

$q .=" LIMIT ".$per_page." OFFSET ".$offset;
*-------*

SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name
LIMIT :per_page OFFSET :offset;

:per_page represents the maximum number of rows to be returned per page, and :offset represents the starting position of the result set for each page. 
For example, if you want to retrieve 10 rows per page and start from the 11th row for the second page,
you can set :per_page to 10 and :offset to 10.

Count Distinct (Example)

"SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT session_id) as session_count FROM $wpdb->prefix".$history_tbl." 
WHERE user_id =".$crr_user." AND category_id= ".$parent." AND child_category_id=".$term_id

***************************

HAVING Clause (Example)

The HAVING clause can reference and filter based on the results of aggregate functions, as shown in the previous example. In contrast, 
the WHERE clause typically filters rows based on individual column values and does not operate on the results of aggregate functions.

SELECT country, SUM(order_amount) AS total_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY country
HAVING total_amount > 100;
